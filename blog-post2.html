        <h1>Cyber Security Trends in 2025</h1>

        <p>
            As digital technology expands across industries, cyber threats have evolved into
            smarter and more sophisticated attacks. The year 2025 is shaping up to be a defining
            moment for cybersecurity, pushing companies, developers, and governments to rethink
            protection strategies. Here are the key cyber security trends transforming the digital world.
        </p>

        <h2>1. AI-Powered Threat Detection</h2>
        <p>
            AI is now being used to detect unusual system behaviors within seconds.
            Machine learning algorithms analyze huge amounts of data, automatically identifying
            hacking patterns faster than humans ever could.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Biometric Authentication</h2>
        <p>
            Passwords are becoming obsolete. Fingerprint scanning, voice recognition, and even
            behavioral metrics (like how you type) are replacing traditional logins to improve security.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Rise of Zero-Trust Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The “trust nothing” model is now a global standard. Every device and user must be verified
            at all times—no automatic access, no exceptions.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Cloud Security Expansion</h2>
        <p>
            With more businesses migrating to cloud services, cybercriminals are targeting cloud
            databases. Cloud encryption and advanced firewalls are becoming mandatory.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Blockchain for Security</h2>
        <p>
            Blockchain technology is being used to secure transactions, verify identities, and
            protect data from unauthorized edits or breaches.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Increase in Ransomware Attacks</h2>
        <p>
            Ransomware is still one of the fastest-growing threats. Hackers target organizations
            that lack strong backup systems, forcing them to pay large sums to recover data.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Cybersecurity Skills Demand Surges</h2>
        <p>
            Companies worldwide are struggling to find cybersecurity experts. This shortage
            is driving massive investments in security training and automation.
        </p>
